- (NEW) This app is currently unavailable online. If you wish to try it, you will have to deploy it.

## USAGE

- Please note that all data is stored in localStorage. 
- The objective of this Web App is to manage your income and expenses in a unique browser, preferably in your mobile device.
- In order to massively delete all data stored, you will have to execute the following command: 

```bash
localStorage.clear()
```

- If you wish to individually delete an income or expense, you will have to click on the 'X' at the right of the data.
